# Exercise1_Interactions-Example

<strong>Virtual reality (VR)</strong> represents another way of interaction between the user and a specific environment, in which some technological components take special importance (i.e., powerful computer, VR viewers, head-mounted displays, head-phones, motion-sensing gloves, etc.). This document consists on a tutorial whose main intention is to put the user in contact with some specific technologies related with Virtual Reality. In particular, we will focus on SteamVR.

<strong>SteamVR</strong> is a virtual reality system, with a headset built by Valve and partner HTC and the headset itself is called the HTC Vive. Similar to what happens with Oculus Rift, the Vive is a VR device that contains two screens (1080x1200 resolution) streaming data at high refresh rates (90Hz) to create the sense of 3D virtual reality. In a common scenario, the headset will connect via a hardwire to a PC, which will run games and other VR software. However, it is also possible to test the different available possibilities within a simulator.

The main intention of this document is to put the user in contact with the <strong>SteamVR Interaction System</strong>, which is included in the SteamVR asset package for Unity. This objective is intended to be tackled by developing two main tasks:

  1. <strong>Break down one of the examples that are available in this Interaction System</strong>, describing it in a deep way. In our case, we will focus on the <strong>Throwables example</strong>.
  2. Once the example has been studied and split into smaller pieces of knowledge, we will <strong>create a very simple mini-game in which we are going to extend the functionality of the straightforward mentioned example</strong>.
